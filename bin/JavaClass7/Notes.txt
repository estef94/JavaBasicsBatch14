Java Class 7
switch syntax
switch (variable) {
	case value1:
		code A;
		break;
	case value2:
		code B;
		break;
	default:
		code C;
		break;
	}
	
	Limitations:
		Data Type: CANNOT work with double, float, long, boolean
		
		Operators: CANNOT work with logical and relational
		
	Loops - A statement that repeats many codes without having to use many codes
	
	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");			
	System.out.println("good morning");	
	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");		
	
	int time=10;
	
	if (time<12) {
		System.out.println("good morning");
	}	
	
	while (time<12) {
		System.out.println("good morning");	
	}
	
	while loop syntax
	
	while (boolean condition) {
	
		code to be repeated;
	}
	
	do while loop
	
	do while loop syntax
	
	d { 
		code to be repeated; 
		
	} while(boolean condition); 
	
	while vs do while --> both loops executed while condition is true
	
	while loop first CHECKS condition -> if true -> executes code
	do while first EXECUTES code --> then checks condition 
	
	for loop syntax
	
	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	
		code to be repeated; 
	}
	
	// Hello 5 times
	
	for (int i=1; i<=5; i++) {
	
		System.out.println("Hello");
			
	}
	
	When to use which loop:
	
	When we know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE FOR LOOP
	
	when we do not know in advance how many times to repeat block of code
	-> USE WHILE OR DO WHILE
