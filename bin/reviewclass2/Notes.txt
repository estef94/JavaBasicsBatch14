Type Casting:
Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another one.
We have two types of casting.
1.) Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
2.) Implicit/Widening/Automatic
When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called Explicit/Narrowing/Manual and 
when we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type we call it Implicit/Widening/Automatic
byte(8) short (16) char (16) int (32) long (64) float (32) double (64)
byte->short->char->int->long->float->double
Why do we need type casting?
 -When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different decimal part
 as we are only interested in the non-decimal part.
 What is the syntax?
  Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
        int box=1000;
        byte box2=(byte) box;
 Implicit/Widening/Automatic
 
 short box1=250;
 int box2=box1;
 =====================================================================================
 If statements:
 	if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on 
 	some condition and provided data. 
 	if conditions 
 	if else condition
 	if else if condition
 	nested if else condition 
Why we should learn about if else condtion? 
	when we are solving real life problems
	like testing a web site our program needs to make a lot of decisions.
What is the syntax of if else conditions?
if condition

boolean rich=true;
	
	if(rich)
	
	{
	System.out.println("Lets buy a Jet Island")
	}
